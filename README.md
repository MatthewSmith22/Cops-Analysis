# Cops-Analysis

This project compares the income of the San Antonio police department to that of the departments of the other four largest cities in Texas: Houston, Dallas, Austin, amd Fort Worth. The data comes from the Texas Tribune Government Salary Explorer.

I did some initial data cleaning in Excel since the data from the Tribune are in Excel spreadsheets. Each city had its own dataset that consisted of all city employees. So I pulled just the police deparment employees for each city and created their own Excel spreadsheet. Next I made the cities' compenstation data uniform. San Antonio's was yearly, so I adjusted the other cities' data accordingly.

I chose to include all employees of the police departments, not just uniformed officers. These non-uniformed employees are an integral part of their repective departments and I felt they should be included in this analysis.

I then read the newly created Excel files into R where I continued cleaning and exploring the data.
